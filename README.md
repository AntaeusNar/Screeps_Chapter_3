# Screeps_Chapter_3
Where we try for a Third Major Time

This is going to become revision 4 Empire!

## Empire
Empire is the main object that the game with run using.  Empire will be divided into Dominions, each Dominion a collection of rooms and all underthings.  

Dominions will function as desecrate sections of the game, each with its own resources, creeps, and goals.  Each Dominion will have stages/Roles that will guide its activities and goals.  At the start a Dominion will be a Colony, which will last until it has Storage.  Colony's grow into Outposts from the time they have a Storage until they are level 8, at level 8 they become Districts.

Dominions will also have various roles, Ports (focused on establishing new Colonies), Plantations (focused on generating raw resources for the Empire), Factories (focused on producing higher level resources), Citadels (focused on military production and expansion), and Temples (focused on simply increasing Room Control)
